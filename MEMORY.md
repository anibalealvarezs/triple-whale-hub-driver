# Triple Whale Hub Driver Memory
## Scope
- Package role: Normalization (Drivers)
- Purpose: This package operates within the Normalization (Drivers) layer of the APIs Hub SaaS hierarchy, providing data normalization for the Triple Whale ecosystem.

## Local working rules
- Consult `AGENTS.md` first for package-specific instructions.
- Use this `MEMORY.md` for repository-specific decisions, learnings, and follow-up notes.
- Use `D:\laragon\www\_shared\AGENTS.md` and `D:\laragon\www\_shared\MEMORY.md` for cross-repository protocols and workspace-wide learnings.
- Keep secrets, credentials, tokens, and private endpoints out of this file.
## Current notes
- Triple Whale driver should map analytics data into the orchestrator contract.
